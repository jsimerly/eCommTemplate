One important consideration is the time of day that you'll be visiting. Early mornings and late afternoons tend to be the best times to hit the beach, particularly if you're with young children. During these times, the sun is not as intense, and there are generally fewer crowds, providing more space to play and relax. In contrast, midday sun can be harsh, and there may be a large number of people, making it hard to find a suitable spot."

For instance, if you plan to swim, bring along sunscreen, towels, and a change of clothes. Similarly, if you want to build sandcastles or play beach volleyball, pack some shovels, buckets, and balls. Proper planning will help ensure that you have everything you need for a fun, memorable day at the beach."

Therefore, it is important to take adequate measures to protect your child's skin from the sun's harmful rays. In addition to applying sunscreen, make sure your child wears a hat and protective clothing to cover as much skin as possible.

It is recommended that children under the age of five be supervised by an adult within arm's reach at all times.
